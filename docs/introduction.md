# Introduction

## Project Overview

A1G Frontend Challenge is a modern, high-performance e-commerce application built with React and TypeScript. The application demonstrates best practices in frontend development, including state management, performance optimization, and component architecture.

## Key Features

- **Product Management**
  - Real-time product listing with virtualized scrolling
  - Dynamic stock management
  - Progressive image loading
  - Efficient product filtering and search

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
  - Virtualized lists for handling large datasets
  - Progressive image loading
  - Memoized components and calculations

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a feature-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── features/       # Feature-specific modules
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
├── services/       # API and service layer
├── utils/          # Utility functions
├── types/          # TypeScript definitions
└── styles/         # Global styles and themes
```

Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, and business logic, promoting modularity and maintainability.

## Performance Considerations

The application implements several performance optimizations:

1. **Data Management**
   - Efficient caching with React Query
   - Optimistic updates for better UX

2. **UI Performance**
   - Virtualized lists for large datasets
   - Progressive image loading
   - Memoized components and calculations
   - Code splitting and lazy loading

3. **Build Optimization**
   - Tree shaking
   - Code splitting
   - Asset optimization
   - Bundle size monitoring
